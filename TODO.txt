BUG: Sphere normals will be wrong if you are inside the sphere since they are not corrected based on camera position, unlike planes.

GENIMP: More configurable texture mapping, such as:
	- azimuth/inclination offset for spheres
	- texture rotation for planes (currently uses getOrthagonal)
	
FEATURE: HDR lightmap
